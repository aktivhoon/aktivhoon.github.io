I am a **Psychiatry Resident at SNUH** navigating the intersection of clinical wisdom and mathematical rigor. I’ve always been driven to decode the "algorithms" of the human mind 🧠. 

**What I'm currently into:**

- **Computational Psychiatry** 💻: Translating subjective mental states into the objective language of math.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** 🕹️: Exploring how the brain updates its "policy" to navigate an uncertain world.
- **Representation Learning** 🕸️: Finding low-dimensional beauty within the high-dimensional chaos of human thought.

**My Path:**

* **KAIST (Ph.D.) 🔬**: Thesis on the geometry of learning and the functional role of the orbitofrontal cortex in mental representation.
* **SNU Medicine (M.D.)** 🩺: Learning to solve inverse problems in clinical settings
* **KAIST (B.S.)** 🧬: Building a foundation in life sciences and computational logic.

I believe the future of psychiatry lies in bridging the gap between the clinic and the computer. When I’m not with patients, I’m likely tweaking a model or exploring formal logic.
