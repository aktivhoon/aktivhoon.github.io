This blog is a record of thoughts made possible by the incredible people I’ve met. I am deeply grateful to those who helped me grow, connected me with great minds, and gave me the right advice whenever I faced challenges. You all pulled me from the ordinary and pushed me toward excellence.

I want to thank my family, and especially my **fiance**, for the constant love and support that keeps me grounded. I also want to thank my friends, who are always a source of inspiration and great motivation for everything I do.
